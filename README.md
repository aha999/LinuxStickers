# Linux Stickers
This is a repository for all kinds of Linux graphics that can be used as in printing stickers.

- If the software, used in creating the graphic is free & open source [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/), the file should be in Inkscape SVG format and having such suffix in name.

- The files are uploaded in Inkscape SVG format for best compatibility with said software.

- Each sticker will currently be located in a separate folder, because next to the SVG files, there should be a PNG file of the same graphic, used for a preview in a web browser.
